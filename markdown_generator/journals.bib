abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York. Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is a population-based, stochastic optimization technique inspired by the social dynamics of birds. The PSO algorithm is rather sensitive to the control parameters, and thus, there has been a significant amount of research effort devoted to the dynamic adaptation of these parameters. The focus of the adaptive approaches has largely revolved around adapting the inertia weight as it exhibits the clearest relationship with the exploration/exploitation balance of the PSO algorithm. However, despite the significant amount of research efforts, many inertia weight control strategies have not been thoroughly examined analytically nor empirically. Thus, there are a plethora of choices when selecting an inertia weight control strategy, but no study has been comprehensive enough to definitively guide the selection. This paper addresses these issues by first providing an overview of 18 inertia weight control strategies. Secondly, conditions required for the strategies to exhibit convergent behaviour are derived. Finally, the inertia weight control strategies are empirically examined on a suite of 60 benchmark problems. Results of the empirical investigation show that none of the examined strategies, with the exception of a randomly selected inertia weight, even perform on par with a constant inertia weight.},

@article{Harrison2019,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2019 This paper presents an investigation into the short-term versus long-term performance of various particle swarm optimization (PSO) control parameter configurations. While evidence suggests that the best PSO parameter values to employ are time-dependent, this paper provides an in-depth examination of a small set of parameter values to provide a more concrete quantification of the performance degradation observed with specific control parameter configurations over time. Given that the short-term performance is not necessarily indicative of long-term performance, this paper proposes that machine learning techniques be used to build predictive models based on two easily-observable landscape characteristics. Finally, using the predictive models as a basis, this paper also proposes a parameter-free PSO algorithm, which performs on par with other top-performing PSO variants, namely the three best performing static PSO configurations, particle swarm optimization with time-varying acceleration coefficients (PSO-TVAC), and particle swarm optimization with improved random constants (PSO-iRC).},
