I am a Research Associate with the School of Engineering and Information Technology at the University of New South Wales (UNSW) Canberra, Australia. Previously, I was a Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of Ontario Institute of Technology (Ontario Tech University), Canada. I received my PhD in Computer Science from the University of Pretoria, South Africa, in 2018, and the M.Sc. and B.Sc. degrees in Computer Science from Brock University, Canada, in 2014 and 2012, respectively.

My research interests include computational intelligence, self-adaptive optimization, fitness landscape analysis, operations research, and real-world applications of complex networks. I have co-authored numerous publications in top-tier journals and conferences and serve as a reviewer for various publication venues in the computational intelligence, evolutionary computation, and operations research domains.
